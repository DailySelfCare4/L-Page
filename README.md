        <p>Explore top-rated self-care products on Amazon and elevate your daily routine.</p>
        <p>Hi! I’m Isabella, a self-care enthusiast dedicated to helping you find the best products to enhance your well-being. I believe that self-care should be enjoyable and affordable for everyone. Some of these products I’ve personally used, while others are recommended based on thorough research. My goal is to ensure you have the best experience with these carefully selected items!</p>
        <h2>Start Your Self-Care Journey Now with a Book!</h2>
			<p>Books are a great way to learn about a subject or enhance your knowledge in a particular area. While reading isn’t for everyone, discovering the right book can transform your perspective on various aspects of life.</p>

            <img src="ThePivotYear.jpg" alt="The Pivot Year">
            <h3><p><strong>Citation:</strong><em> The Pivot Year </em>by Brianna Wiest</p></h3>
            <p>I just started this book and so far I really like it. I wasn't expecting the layout at first because there is a passage for each day, but I have found I have gotten more out of this blueprint. If you are looking for a book that has insightful information in small doses, this is for you. </p>

            <h3>Ordinary's Niacinamide + Zinc Serum</h3>
            <p>This serum is personally my favorite. I have been using this for over a year now and there is never a day I can go without this product. Surprisingly, I feel like this product doesn't get as much hype as the hyaluronic acid serum. But in my case it works in my favor because the store will never be out of stock :) This serum is great for people that have oiky skin and blemished-prone skin. On top of that, it can be used morning and night!</p>

	     <img src="Silk-pillow.jpg" alt="Silk Pillowcase">
            <p>Silk Pillowcases are a great way to sleep comfortably while also ensuring a safe place for your skin to rest. When sleeping the fabric of silk can repel dirt and bacteria, while also creating less friction reducing inflammation.</p>
